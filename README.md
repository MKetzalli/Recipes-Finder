### General Info
***
This project was made for the BEDU course of web development with javascript, it seeks to demonstrate the skills acquired in the first and second phase (module 1) of the course.

To demonstrate these competences we developed a web project that allows the user to find recipes based on a specific ingredient or to request a random recipe by using the API: https://www.themealdb.com/api.php
